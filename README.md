## Exercices solutions

Most of the exercices came from Isograd : [Solution des concours](https://www.isograd.com/FR/solutionconcours.php)
Our proposed solutions are stored in the `TRAINING` folder

### Naming rules

Each file must be properly named : 

`[exerciesName]-[author].[language]`

Each exercice is stored in a folder, this folder must be explicitly named to easily find the associated exercice.

All those folders have to be stored in a folder with the name of the associated contest. 

The folder named `OTHERS` contains all the exercices solved before the repository refactoring.
